### This module adds some utilities that are not big enough to warrant standalone modules

Some features in this module may conflict with other modules with identical features, in that case, a warning will be given to the GM and the features will be skipped until the other modules are disabled

Due to the nature of some features implemented in this module which require to be ran at the earliest and the unnecessary need for constant checks when said features are disabled, a reload may be required when settings are changed and a prompt will notify you if need be

# Settings

## Automatic Rune Progression (Requires Reload)

Meant to be used in stead of the ABP variant rule to automatically give potency/striking/resilient runes to equipment ; This replaces the `PF2e Automatic Rune Progression` module

## No Dropped Bulk (Requires Reload)

Dropped equipment in an actor's inventory won't be accounted for bulk value calculation

## Npc Lore Knowledges

Adds the option to set custom lores for NPCs ; This replaces the `PF2e Npc Knowledges` module

## Set Un-Identified Image

Automatically set the un-identifed image of items to be the same as the regular image ; This replaces the `PF2e Unided` module

-   `On Creation Only:` Should the un-identified image be set for newly created or imported items
-   `On Creation & Update:` Should the un-identified image also be set when the image of an item is updated

## Remove Effect Shortcut

Using `[Shift + Right Click]` on effect icons in the effects panel will instantly remove all its charges/counters/badges ; This replaces the `Remove Effect` feature of the `PF2e Effect Description` module

## Condition Sheet Icon

Adds a new icon to condition in the effects panel to open their sheet just like you would with non-condition effects
