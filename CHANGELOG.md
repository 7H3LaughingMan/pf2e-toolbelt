# 1.0.0

this module adds some utilities that are not big enough to warrant standalone modules:

-   `No Dropped Bulk`: Dropped equipment in an actor's inventory won't be accounted for bulk value calculation

it will also overlap with some other modules (it is meant to replace them):

-   PF2e Unided
-   PF2e Automatic Rune Progression
-   PF2e Npc Knowledges
-   PF2e Effect Description

when such module is active in your world, the GM will receive a warning for each one of them
